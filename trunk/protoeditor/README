1.0 About:

  Protoeditor is a small KDE text editor developed for debugging
  scripts interactively. The goal is to provide a simple editor supporting a
  variety of debuggers for different languages. Currently, it supports the
  following languages and debuggers:
  
  PHP:
   - DBG debugger (free version 2.13.1) at http://dd.cron.ru/dbg/
   - Xdebug (tested with CVS version 2.0.0beta3-dev).
   - Gubed 0.2.2

  Perl:
   - DBGp debugger, shipped in this package. It can also be 
     found at ftp://ftp.activestate.com

  Python
   - DBGp debugger, shipped in this package. It can also be
     found at ftp://ftp.activestate.com

  Protoeditor uses katepart as the text editor, so all the functionalities of
  a _good_ editor are present (highlights, folding marks, etc, etc, etc) wich 
  makes the debug experience more pratical.

  Besides the editor, it supports common debugger features like:
  steps, watches, backtrace, breakpoints, etc. Other features depend on what 
  the debuggers supports.


1.1 Requirements:

  * KDE 3.2 + should be fine (if not, let me know :)
  * For local debug, you need a interpreter (ie. PHP, Perl, etc) and, at least, 
    one debugger installed in your system.
    For remote debug, you need the remote system to be properly installed
    (webserver + debugger module + additional configuration).  
  
2.0 Configuration and Use

  See Protoeditor manual for a description of the settings and
  features Protoeditor provides (execute Protoeditor and
  press F1 or Menu "Help" -> "Protoeditor's Handbook").

  For a walk through on installing and configuring the debuggers and 
  Protoeditor, see the "Tutorial" section on Protoeditor's homepage.

2.1 Debugger Configuration

  2.1.1 PHP

    For Xdebug and DBG, check you phpinfo() if they were successfuly installed.
  
    For details about DBG installation, check the DBG site: 
      http://dd.cron.ru
  
    For details about Xdebug installation, check the Xdebug site:
      http://www.xdebug.org
  
    For details about Gubed installation, check the Gubed site:
      http://gubed.sourceforge.net

  2.1.2 Perl and Python

    There is no extra configuration needed to start debugging Perl/Python
    scripts locally. Protoeditor installs automatically the debuggers
    in it's data directory (usually /opt/kde/share/apps/protoeditor/libs/perl) 
    so it doesn't conflict with your system library.

    To debug remotelly, you will need to copy the DBGp debugger library to 
    the server host and configure the webserver. You might want to check
    "Enable JIT" on Protoeditor language settings as well.

    2.1.2.1 Remote debugging Perl 

      If the remote server is the localhost, and you are using Apache, you could 
      add the following to httpd.conf (assuming mod_env is installed and DBGp is 
      in the default  directory):
  
          SetEnv PERL5LIB "/opt/kde/share/apps/protoeditor/libs/perl/"
          SetEnv PERLDB_OPTS "RemotePort=localhost:9001"
  
      Then, restarting the server and settings "perl -d" to the shebang in the
      cgi-script (ie. "#!/usr/bin/perl -d") should be enough.

    2.1.3 Remote debugging Python
    
      So far, I haven't tested remote debugging with Python DBGp. 
      Instructions for such can be found at:
  
      http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/docs/Komodo/3.5/komodo-doc-debugpython.html

2.1.1 Protoeditor configuration

  Check your debugger options on Protoeditor settings. Most of them are self
  explanatory, but I'll give some hints ;)

  In the language tabs:

    The "<Language> command" specifies the path for the interpreter binary. 
    Togueter with the "External console" settings in "External Application", 
    it is used to execute/debug scripts locally using a console application, 
    if desired.
  
    The "Default debugger" chosen is the one to be used on local debugging 
    sessions, when no site is currently selected.
  
    Every debugger has a JIT option. If enabled, Protoeditor will listen on the 
    given port while the application is running. Otherwise, it will only listen 
    to the port when a debug session is active.
  
    In "External Applications" you can select a browser to use while debugging
    remote scripts and a console to execute/debug the scripts locally, using
    the PHP binary.

2.1.2 Sites

    From version 0.6, Protoeditor supports different settings for remote/local  
    directory mapping. On other IDE's this is simply the configuration for
    a given project. Since Protoeditor is not project centric, it uses "Site"
    configuration to figure how to access the HTTP server, how to map
    the paths of the scripts and which debugger it uses. 
    Each site has the following entries:

      -Site name        : a simple name to identify this site.
      -URL              : the URL of the http server.
      -Remote base dir  : the remote directory of the site.
      -Local base dir   : the local directory of the site.
      -Default file     : the default script to be debugged when this site is
                          selected.
      -Debugger         : the debugger for this site.

    Many Sites can be registered, and additional directory mappings added. 
    The Sites are selected through the combo box on the main window toolbar 
    or in the main menu. Also there is a default "-- Local --", wich is used 
    for local debug since it doesn't need a directory mapping, URL, etc.

    When starting the debugger for a remote session, it will make an HTTP
    request directly or use one of the browsers chosen from "External
    Applications" settings. The request uses the Site's host:port and the
    given directories to map file paths from remote to local and vice-versa.
    If the Site has a "default file", it will be opened automatically (or
    activated, if already  opened), otherwise, Protoeditor will ask you to open 
    a file.

    Example of a local Site:

    Site name       : home
    URL             : http://192.168.0.1:8080
    Remote base dir : /var/www/htdocs
    Local base dir  : /usr/apache/htdocs/phpsite
    Default file    : /usr/apache/htdocs/phpsite/index.php
    Debugger        : PHP DBG
