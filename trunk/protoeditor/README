                            Protoeditor Beta 0.5

Project site:

  http://protoeditor.sourceforge.net/

1.0 About:

  Protoeditor is a little KDE text editor developed for PHP debugging with the
  free version of DBG debugger (http://dd.cron.ru/dbg).
  It is a product of the development process of a DBG debugger client for
  the Quanta+ project (http://www.kdewebdev.org), but got quite usable.

  Protoeditor uses katepart as the text editor, so all the functionalities of a
  _good_ editor are present (highlights, folding marks, etc, etc, etc).
  As you will see, I didn't care too mutch to how it looks, since the point
  is not to make some kind of IDE. This is just a software constructed for testing
  purposes that became quite usable for quick debugging.

  Ok, the main DBG features are present: steps, watches, stack/backtrace,
  breakpoints, conditional breakpoints...There are little things missing (and crashing)
  here and there, but with those, we can do what we actually need. Remember: this is a
  client for the *free* version of DBG. Don't try to use it with the commercial
  version. Won't work!

2.0 Notes

  2.1 Kate

  The first time you execute Protoeditor, its configuration won't exist so,
  kate will load the default settings for the editor, wich might not include Icon Border.
  Just open a file, goto "Editor" -> "Configure" and, on "View defaults",
  mark "Show Icon Border", so you can see the execution point and breakpoints.

  2.2 Debugger Configuration

  First, configure your php DBG module. Make sure it is active with phpinfo().

  To configure DBG on Protoeditor:

    Set the "Local basedir" to your local root folder (ie. /home/me/php/helloworld).
    On "Server basedir", the remote location of the root folder
    (ie. /usr/apache/htdocs/helloworld). For "Listen port", you can choose the
    default: 7869. This is the port on wich your computer waits for DBG connection.
    Finally, set the "Host" to the http server address (ie. 192.168.0.30).

    If you are debugging everything locally, just setup to something like:

    Local basedir  : /home/me/phpsite
    Server basedir : /usr/apache/htdocs/phpsite
    Listen port    : 7869
    Host           : localhost

    Now, open the hipotetical /home/me/phpsite/index.php.
    Start the debug session on the menu (it starts to listen the connection).
    Oh well, just run and have fun.


  2.3 Main window

    Now, some tricks and notes:

      -On the variables list, you can expand the array/object childs and
      on the next stepin/stepout/break, the item remains expanded (I haven't seen this
      implemented in many PHP IDE's ;-)

      -Again, on the variables list and watches, you can change the value
      of some variable on the fly: just double click on the value and change it.

      -Multiple breakpoints on the same file/line currently is not supported.

3.0 Future plans

  DBG is good. Very good. But there are some catches for the free version. So, when I finish
  the DBG client, I might start working on XDebug (http://www.xdebug.org/) support.

4.0 Extra info

  I started working on this a year ago because, at the time, I needed for my job
  (working with php applications on GNU/Linux). We didn't want to spend money on
  commercial products (as a matter of fact, we didn't like the available ones).
  Since the free version of DBG satisfied me, I planned to integrate a client into
  the KDE Quanta+ project (http://www.kdewebdev.org) wich, at the time, Gubed
  (http://gubed.sourceforge.net) was beginning to be incorporated. Also, there
  was a discussion about incorporating many debuggers of many script languages into it.
  So, be ready for Quanta+ :)


5.0 Troubleshooting

  5.1 Nothing happens when hitting "Run".

    If you are trying to run and nothing happens, first, make sure you can access the http server.
    Then, take a look at the debug output on the console. It should have something like:

      "protoeditor: Requesting "/index.php?DBGSESSID=753@clienthost:7869" from 192.168.0.20

    Where "/index.php" is the file you are running, "7869" is the port you typed on "Listen port" of
    the configuration and "192.168.0.20" is the host you typed on "Host".

    This is like an HTTP request, so if you see something like:

      "protoeditor: Requesting "/home/me/test/index.php?DBGSESSID=753@clienthost:7869" from 192.168.0.20

    You probably typed something wrong for the paths.
