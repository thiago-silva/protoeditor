1.0 About:

  Protoeditor is a small KDE text editor developed for debugging
  scripts interactively. The goal is to provide a simple editor supporting a
  variety of debuggers for different languages. Currently (beta 0.8), it
  only supports PHP and the following debuggers:

   - DBG debugger (free version 2.11) at http://dd.cron.ru/dbg/
   - Xdebug (tested with CVS version 2.0.0beta3-dev).
   - Gubed 0.2.2

  Protoeditor uses katepart as the text editor, so all the functionalities of
  a _good_ editor are present (highlights, folding marks, etc, etc, etc) wich 
  makes the debug experience more pratical.

  Besides the editor, it supports common debugger features like:
  steps, watches, backtrace, breakpoints, etc. Other features depend on what 
  the debuggers supports.


1.1 Requirements:

  * KDE 3.2 + should be fine (if not, let me know :)


1.2 Upgrades:

  Since Protoeditor has many things that changes over the releases, the 
  file settings (default on ~/.kde/share/config/protoeditorrc) might not be 
  valid for a newer version. So, if something is odd with configurations, 
  try deleting this file  and run Protoeditor right after.


2.0 Configuration

  For a walk through on installing and configuring the debuggers and Protoeditor,
  see the "Tutorial" section on Protoeditor's homepage.


2.1 Debugger Configuration

  For Xdebug and DBG, check you phpinfo() if they were successfuly installed.

  For details about DBG installation, check the DBG site: 
    http://dd.cron.ru

  For details about Xdebug installation, check the Xdebug site:
    http://www.xdebug.org

  For details about Gubed installation, check the Gubed site:
    http://gubed.sourceforge.net

  
2.1.1 Protoeditor configuration

  Check your debugger options on Protoeditor settings. Most of them are self
  explanatory, but I'll give some hints ;)

  The "PHP Binary path" specifies the path for the PHP binary. Togueter with 
  the "External console" settings in "External Application", it is used to 
  execute/debug scripts locally using a console application, if desired.

  The "Default debugger" chosen is the one to be used on local debugging 
  sessions.

  Every debugger has a JIT option. If enabled, Protoeditor will listen on the 
  given port while the application is running. Otherwise, it will only listen 
  to the port when a debug session is active.

  In "External Applications" you can select a browser to use while debugging
  remote scripts and a console to execute/debug the scripts locally, using
  the PHP binary.

2.1.2 Sites

    From version 0.6, Protoeditor supports different settings for remote/local  
    directory mapping. On other IDE's this is simply the configuration for
    a given project. Since Protoeditor is not project centric, it uses "Site"
    configuration to figure how to access the HTTP server, how to map
    the paths of the scripts and which debugger it used. 
    Each site has the following entries:

      -Site name        : a simple name to identify this site.
      -URL              : the URL of the http server.
      -Remote base dir  : the remote directory of the site.
      -Local base dir   : the local directory of the site.
      -Default file     : the default script to be debuged when this site is
                          selected.
      -Debugger         : the debugger for this site.

    Many Sites can be registered and they are selected through the combo box on
    the main window toolbar or in the main menu. Also there is a default 
    "-- Local --", wich is used for local debug since it doesn't need a 
    directory mapping, URL, etc.

    When starting the debugger for a remote session, it will make an HTTP
    request directly or use one of the browsers chosen from "External
    Applications" settings. The request uses the Site's host:port and the
    given directories to map file paths from remote to local and vice-versa.
    If the Site has a "default file", it will be opened automatically (or
    activated, if already  opened), otherwise, Protoeditor will ask you to open 
    a file.

    Example of a local Site:

    Site name       : home
    URL             : http://192.168.0.1:8080
    Remote base dir : /var/www/htdocs
    Local base dir  : /usr/apache/htdocs/phpsite
    Default file    : /usr/apache/htdocs/phpsite/index.php
    Debugger        : DBG


3.0 Main window

    Now, some tricks, notes and features:

      Variales list:

        -Expanded array/object childs remains expanded through
         step-in/step-out/break.

        -To modify a variable value on the fly, simply double click on it's
         value and edit it (as long as the debugger used supports it).

        -Right button on a variable popup a menu to copy the variable to the
         clipboard.

      Breakpoints:

        -Multiple breakpoints on the same file/line is _not_ supported.

      Site script:
        
        -If you have set a Default file in a given Site configuration, everytime
        you try to run/debug, Protoeditor will use this file. If you want
        to run/debug another script using the same Site configuration, select
        the option "Use Current Script" in the menu/toolbar so the active
        script in the editor is used.


4.0 Profiler

    Currently, DBG Profiler is supported. Be sure to have it enabled on php.ini
    settings.
