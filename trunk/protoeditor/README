                            Protoeditor

Project site:

  http://protoeditor.sourceforge.net/

1.0 About:

  Protoeditor is a small KDE text editor developed for PHP debugging with the
  free version of DBG debugger (http://dd.cron.ru/dbg), version 2.11.*.
  It was first implemented as a test application while doing a plugin for
  Quanta+ (http://www.kdewebdev.org) and now it became quite usable.

  Protoeditor uses katepart as the text editor, so all the functionalities of a
  _good_ editor are present (highlights, folding marks, etc, etc, etc).
  This makes the debug experience more pratical.

  Besides the editor and appearence, Protoeditor supports the main DBG features:
  steps, watches, stack/backtrace, breakpoints, conditional breakpoints...
  There are little things missing (and crashing) here and there, but with those,
  we can do what we actually need. Remember: this is a client for the *free* version
  of DBG. Don't try to use it with the commercial version. Won't work!

2.0 Requirements:

  * KDE 3.2 + should be fine.

3.0 Notes

  3.1 Kate

  The first time you execute Protoeditor, its configuration won't exist so,
  kate will load the default settings for the editor, wich might not include Icon Border.
  Just open a file (so you can configure the editor), goto "Editor" -> "Configure"
  and, on "View defaults", mark "Show Icon Border". Then you will be able to see
  the execution points and breakpoints.

  3.2 Debugger Configuration

  First, configure your php DBG module. Make sure it is active with phpinfo().
  For details about DBG installation, check the DBG site: http://dd.cron.ru

  To configure DBG on Protoeditor:

    Check the DBG options on Protoeditor settings. Most of them are self explanatory.
    (Yes, I will work on appropriated documentation).

    JIT note: if enabled, Protoeditor will listen on the given port while the application
    is running. Otherwise, it will only listen to the port when a debug session is active.

    Sites:

      From version 0.6, Protoeditor supports different settings for remote/local
      directory mapping. On other IDE's this is simply the configuration for a given project.
      Since Protoeditor is not project centric, it uses "Site" configuration.
      Each site has the following entries:

        -Site name       : a simple name to identify this site
        -Host            : the ip/hostname of the http server
        -Port            : the port of the http server
        -Remote base dir : the remote directory of the site (eg. /var/www/htdocs/mysite)
        -Local base dir  : the local directory of the site (eg. /home/me/mysite)
        -Default file    : the default script to be debuged when this site is selected.
        
        (other entries might appear in future versions)

    Many Sites can be registered and they are selected through the combo box on the
    main window toolbar. When starting the debugger, it will connect to the Site's
    host:port and use the given directories to map file paths from remote to local
    and vice-versa. If the Site has a "default file", it will be opened automatically (or
    activated, if already opened).

    Example of a local Site:

    Site name       : home
    Host            : localhost
    Port            : 80
    Remote base dir : /home/me/phpsite
    Local base dir  : /usr/apache/htdocs/phpsite
    Default file    : /usr/apache/htdocs/phpsite/index.php

  3.3 Profiler

    Currently, DBG Profiler is supported. Be sure to have it enabled on php.ini settings.
    It still very basic, but matches the same basic features of other IDE's that uses DBG profiler.
    Also, there are plans to go further on profile analysis and statistics.
    
  3.4 Main window

    Now, some tricks, notes and not-so-obvious-features:

      Variales list:

        -Expanded array/object childs remains expanded through step-in/step-out/break,
        (I haven't seen this implemented in many PHP IDE's ;-)

        -To modify a variable value on the fly, simply double click on it's value and
        edit it.

        -Right button on a variable popup a menu to copy the variable to the clipboard.

      Breakpoints:

        -Multiple breakpoints on the same file/line is not supported.

      Browsers:

        -When using Konqueror, Protoeditor keeps talking to the same window. This is
        not possible on the other browsers (Protoeditor uses the topmost instance).

4.0 Future plans

  DBG is good. Very good. But there are some catches for the free version. So, when I finish
  the DBG client, I might start working on XDebug (http://www.xdebug.org/) and Gubed
  (http://gubed.sourceforge.net) support. Also, other debuggers for languages such as python
  and perl would be nice.

5.0 Extra info

  I started working on this a year ago because, at the time, I needed for my job
  (working with php applications on GNU/Linux). We didn't want to spend money on
  commercial products (as a matter of fact, we didn't like the available ones).
  Since the free version of DBG satisfied me, I planned to integrate a client into
  the KDE Quanta+ (http://www.kdewebdev.org) wich, at the time, Gubed
  (http://gubed.sourceforge.net) was beginning to be incorporated. Also, there
  was a discussion about incorporating many debuggers of many script languages into it.
  So, be ready for Quanta+ :)


5.0 Troubleshooting

  5.1 Nothing happens when I start the debugger.

    If you are trying to run the debugger and nothing happens,
    first, make sure you can access the http server and DBG is installed and configured
    properly. Then, take a look at Protoeditor output on the console.
    It should have something like:

      "protoeditor: Requesting "/index.php?DBGSESSID=753@clienthost:7869" from 192.168.0.20

    Where the relevant data are:
      /index.php   - the file you are running.
      7869         - the port you typed on "Listen port" of DBG settings.
      192.168.0.20 - the host you typed on your current Site's "Host".

    This is an HTTP request, so if you see something like:

      "protoeditor: Requesting "/home/me/test/index.php?DBGSESSID=753@clienthost:7869" from 192.168.0.20

    unless you can access "http://192.168.0.20/home/me/test/index.php",
    you probably set incorrect values for local/remote base dirs on the Site settings.
