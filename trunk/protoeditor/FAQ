  Q: Why another editor? Why not work directly on Quanta+, for instance?

  A: Ok, a little of history:
     I started working on this a year ago (2004) because, at the time, I needed for my job (working with php 
     applications on GNU/Linux). We didn't want to spend money on commercial products (as a matter of fact, 
     we didn't like the available ones). Since the free version of DBG satisfied me, I planned to implement a 
     client into the KDE Quanta+ (http://www.kdewebdev.org) wich, at the time, Gubed (http://gubed.sourceforge.net) 
     was beginning to be incorporated. On the mailing list, there was a discussion about incorporating many 
     debuggers for many script languages into it.

     Due to lack of time, and because I don't have knowledge of Gubed implementation, I develop this small editor
     (the one you are reading about) so I could better understand about debug session flows and how could DBG and 
     Gubed work togueter sharing common code (wich would be a starting point to easily implement other debuggers 
     without all the suffering) and I could have the freedom to try new things and blow things out like a doctor 
     on its own laboratory :)

     It was fun to do it, but I had too mutch work with DBG, and took me a lot to complete 
     its implementation by myself. So, many "todo" things are still hanging.

     Now, since I had a small app here fullfiling some of my needs, I decided to release it.     


  Q: Nothing happens when I start the debugger. What is wrong?

  A: If you are trying to run the debugger and nothing happens,
     first, make sure you can access the http server and your debugger is installed and configured
     properly. Then, take a look at Protoeditor output on the console.
     For DBG, it should have something like:

       "protoeditor: Requesting "/index.php?DBGSESSID=753@clienthost:7869" from 192.168.0.20

     Where the relevant data are:
       /index.php   - the file you are running.
       7869         - the port you typed on "Listen port" of DBG settings.
       192.168.0.20 - the host you typed on your current Site's "Host".

     This is an HTTP request, so if you see something like:

       "protoeditor: Requesting "/home/me/test/index.php?DBGSESSID=753@clienthost:7869" from 192.168.0.20

     unless you can access "http://192.168.0.20/home/me/test/index.php" in your browser,
     you probably set incorrect values for local/remote base dirs on the Site settings.


  Q: I'm having lots of problems to make this work. What should I do?
  
  A: Go to the forum (http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=439825) and search for related
     problems. If there isn't any solution there, you're welcome to write a new thread :)

     
  Q: What should I do if I find a bug?
  
  A: Try the convenient KDE bug report, or write it on the protoeditor's sourceforge forum.
